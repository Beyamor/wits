title: break on through
date: 01-08-2014

I've been graduated for, good lord, a little over four months now. Some people might take a fortune of time like that and spend it doing something exciting and horizon-expanding like travelling. Me? Well, I'm more of a hide-in-my-room kind of guy.

What've I been doing with this time then? Some might claim long stints in front of my computer were symptomatic of a bone-deep laziness. Faced with this accusation, I throw up my hands and protest (in a squeaky voice) that this was my long-desired *PROJECT TIME*.

As my accuser turns away, I quickly drop my hands. Holding them up there is a lot of effort for these lazy bones.

Anyway, much as I've enjoyed taking this break and getting a chance to poke at some ideas which had been kicking around in my head, it's time for me to ~~mess up some interviews~~ find a job. However, I thought it'd be nice to have a summary of my work.

This isn't exactly an exhaustive list - there's a bunch stuff that never ended up online, whether because it was too uninteresting or too underdeveloped or whatever - but it is, indisputably, a list, and, well, there's something to be said for that.
