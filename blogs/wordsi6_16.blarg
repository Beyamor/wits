title: so what are we breathing

Not a good day for productivity, my made up friend, not a good day at all.

Well, alright, I spent most of the day rewatching *Firefly*, so *not good* is perhaps only a suitable description in strange alternate existence wherein things are either *good* or *sweet joy I spent the day rewatching *Firefly* and now I can't utter a sentence without using the word gorram*, in which case, *not good* indeed.

Man, that [Nathan Fillion](http://www.superiorpics.com/hs/nathan_fillion/main1.jpg). There is an irrefutable but often unspoken rule that any man may, at his discretion, maintain a list of three - and only three - other dudes who fall outside the dominion of existing gender predilections, insofar as knocking boots is concerned. That is to say, [David Tennant](http://images1.fanpop.com/images/image_uploads/David-Kiss-david-tennant-1127123_120_120.jpg), [Matt Smith](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/02/12/article-1143446-037D7A2C000005DC-15_468x703.jpg), and of course, [our Mr. Reyolds](http://jossingaround.kabeka.com/images/Screencaps/Firefly/Trash2.jpg) set me all atwitter and *there is nothing wrong with that.*

Anyway, like I said, not much to, er, say. Touched up a bit of the style on this here site and realized I need to sit myself down one of these days and take a good hard look at the principles of aesthetic design. I mostly just fumble my way though, but there's a real art to, well, art. I'm trying to look at the websites that speak to me as pretty with a more critical eye. Y'know, pretty in a manly sort of way.

[css Zen Garden](http://csszengarden.com/) is a great place to stop and mull this kind of thing. The idea behind the site is the beautification of a dead simple [HTML page](http://www.csszengarden.com/?cssfile=none) with nothing more than style. I'm a fan of a subdued sort of minimalism, maybe to the point of offending the senses more than appeasing them, so I'm most drawn to something like [this here](http://www.csszengarden.com/?cssfile=151/151.css), but it's worth taking a gander at the [complete works](http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/alldesigns/) if you've got a mind to this sort of thing.

A few lines non-web code also drifted across the face of my humble editor as I set forth on another adventure in code. I've sort of been tossing the idea of a [regex](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/regular_expressions.png) game back and forth and today I took a few baby steps in that direction. I haven't settled on all the details of the actual creation itself, so we might come back to that, but tying back in to the presentation stuff we mentioned above, most of my work - and I'll use "work" to cling onto an illusion of productivity - was geared towards finding fonts that might feel at home. It's a tough thing because text communicates so much in the way of subtle theme. I mean, can you imagine if [Walt Disney](http://ebooksa2z.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/walt_disney_company.jpg) had used Times New Roman? Every movie would be an hour and a half of Mickey Mouse filling in Excel spreadsheets and adjusting his tie.

Yeah, boring stuff, fair enough all around. Figure I'm just trying to get back into the habit of coughing out my thoughts again. It does a great deal to impose order on ideas or, at least, give them some kind of momentum. Maybe I don't need to do this every day, but I like that it anchors me in my work. So yeah, *blogging*.
