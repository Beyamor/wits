  "A roguelike built in ClojureScript using rot.js"

  :description
  "A roguelike built in ClojureScript using [rot.js](http://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/) following the tutorial on [Coding Cookies](http://www.codingcookies.com/2013/04/01/building-a-roguelike-in-javascript-part-1/).
  Move with the arrow keys. Check your inventory with `I`. Pick up items with `,`. Drop items with `D`. Eat items with `E`. Wield weapons with `W`. Wear armor with `Shift + W`. Confirm menu selections with `Enter`. Cancel out of menus with `Escape`.
  While the implementation is very rough, it does contain some interesting ideas. Check it out."
