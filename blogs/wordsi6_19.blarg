title: a swine before pearls
date: 7-27-2011

Today represents a huge void, productivity-wise. I've accomplished a tear-inducing little in almost every field. Between [recaps](http://www.destructoid.com/blogs/CblogRecaps/cblogs-of-07-27-2011-and-beyamorisms-207271.phtml) and actually [playing games](http://supergiantgames.com/?page_id=242), there's little to put to words here. Why then, dear non-existent reader, have we gone to all the trouble of putting a blog together? A good question and one I can only meet with a humble but moving announcement.

I might be in love with a girl named [Perl](http://www.perl.org/).
